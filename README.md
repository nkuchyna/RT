# RT
The final group project of the graphics branch | Path tracer on GPU coded in C, normed and functionnal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first experience in the implementation of a large group project (after 4 month of learning C language). Our team Sperkhun, Vmartynu, Sbratche put a lot of effort and, as for me, got a pretty good result. My task was to implement texture mapping, cropping, simple and composed objects, color disruption, bump mapping, negative objects, menu and some other stuff. 

The goal - create a program to generate images according to Raytracing protocol (XML format in our case).
Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

Usage: ./RT [file]

BONUS PART
- advanced light management;
- different materials;
- composed objects;
- texture mapping;
- 3D fractals;
- exotic objects;
- global illumination;
- negative objects;
- cropping;
- bump mapping and others.
